# make a scatter plot that graphs SPM (strides per minute) over speed by lap.

# SPM is steps_per_minute but there is not a specific speed coluumn, do I need to calculate it?
# tried this code but the graph looked funny so I decided just to use total_elapsed_time_s:
# laps <- laps %>% 
 # mutate(speed = total_distance_m / total_elapsed_time_s)

# make 5 aesthetic changes to the plot to improve the visual.
